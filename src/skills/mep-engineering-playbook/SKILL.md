  Mandatory engineering playbook for all NestJS CQRS microservice projects at MEP. Every
  agent MUST read and strictly follow the conventions in this playbook before writing any
  line of code — including commands, queries, repositories, entry points, providers,
  services, DTOs, module registration, and file naming. This playbook is the single source
  of truth for code structure, patterns, and style across all MEP projects. Entry points
  may be HTTP controllers, message pattern handlers, gRPC methods, or WebSocket gateways
  depending on the project transport. Success responses MUST use the project-defined
  response helpers. Errors MUST be thrown with a NestJS HTTP exception carrying a module
  error-key constant (`<MODULE>_ERRORS.KEY`) — never a raw string, and never raw Error or
  HttpException.

## Architecture overview

Every feature module follows the **CQRS + Repository** pattern regardless of transport:

```
Incoming request (HTTP / Message / gRPC / WebSocket)
    └─► Entry point        (dispatch only — no business logic)
            ├─► CommandBus ─► CommandHandler ─┬─► Repository / Repositories (owns its own logic)
            │                                  └─► Service ──► (only logic SHARED across handlers)
            └─► QueryBus   ─► QueryHandler   ─┬─► Repository / Repositories (owns its own logic)
                                               └─► Service ──► (only logic SHARED across handlers)
```

**Non-negotiable rules — violating any of these is a bug:**

1. Entry points dispatch to `CommandBus` / `QueryBus` only. Never inject Services or
   Repositories into entry points.
2. **A handler owns its own business logic.** It may inject Repositories (via `@Inject(TOKEN)`),
   the DB provider, and Services directly — including handlers with transactions, multiple
   repositories, or external calls. Logic specific to a single handler lives **in that handler**,
   not in a Service.
3. **Services hold only logic SHARED across multiple handlers.** Extract a method into a Service
   solely when two or more handlers need it (e.g. geocoding, address normalization, a common
   "find-or-throw"). A Service is a library of reusable building blocks, not a mandatory layer a
   handler must route through. Do not move handler-specific logic into a Service just because it
   is long or touches several repositories.
4. When **shared** logic spans multiple repositories, place the Service method in the Service whose
   **domain matches the action** — not the service that owns the "primary" repository.
   Example: `getPermissionsByUserId` → `PermissionService`, not `UserService`.
5. Repositories only communicate with the database. No business logic inside repositories.
6. Commands typically return `null`. They may return a simple scalar (e.g. `id`) when the
   caller needs it, but must never return full data objects.
7. Repository injection always uses **provider token strings**, never direct class injection.
8. **Do not add comments that restate the code.** Names and signatures already describe what a
   class, method, DTO, interface, type, or field _is_ — never add a `@description`/JSDoc block or an
   inline comment just to paraphrase them. Add a comment **only** to explain complex, non-obvious
   business logic (a rule, an edge case, a "why"). See [CONVENTIONS.md](./CONVENTIONS.md).
9. Success responses MUST use the project-defined response helpers — never write raw
   transport responses directly.
10. Errors MUST be thrown with a NestJS HTTP exception (`NotFoundException`,
    `BadRequestException`, …) carrying a **module error-key constant**
    (`<MODULE>_ERRORS.KEY` = `'<MODULE>.<REASON>'`) — never a human-readable string, and never
    `new Error()` / `new HttpException()`. Keys live in
    `<module>/constants/<module>-error.constants.ts`. See [API-DESIGN.md](./API-DESIGN.md) §8.

```

> **Repositories do NOT live in the feature module.** Interfaces, repositories, and providers
> belong to the centralized **`libs/layer-data`** library (`@app/layer-data`). The feature module
> imports a per-domain `*DataModule` and injects the repository token. See
> [REPOSITORIES.md §0](./REPOSITORIES.md#0-data-layer-libslayer-data).

> **Naming quirk** (established convention — do not change):
> `*.command.ts` holds the `@CommandHandler` class; `*.handler.ts` holds the `ICommand`
> class and its Props interface. This is inverted from what the names suggest but is the
> project standard — follow it exactly.
